<i>Red Sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky in the morning, sailor take warning</i>

## Advanced knowledge allows preparation

### The new way  

Use historical data to create expected values for event frequency and losses by 
state and event type

*   number of events per year
*   injuries per 1000 events
*   fatalities per 1000 events
*   property damage per event
*   crop damage per event
